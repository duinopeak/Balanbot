These are all the required libraries for the Balanduino:

* [KalmanFilter](https://github.com/TKJElectronics/KalmanFilter)
* [USB Host Shield Library 2.0](https://github.com/felis/USB_Host_Shield_2.0)

It also contains a modified version of the [Arduino Servo library](http://arduino.cc/en/reference/servo) for the Balanduino.

It is needed since the Balanduino uses Timer1 for PWM for the motors. See the following [commit](https://github.com/TKJElectronics/Balanduino/commit/83dc137c673cce6edd6d88e768625a13a9099643) for more information.
